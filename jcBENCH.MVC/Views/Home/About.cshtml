            Originally created to answer part of the question, how does Device A compare to Device B from a computation perspective irregardless of the platform? In particular, older RISC era computers that wouldn't be able to run PCMark or 3DMark.<br/>

            Over time this grew to support BSD, IRIX, Solaris, Android and many other platforms written in C originally given GCC being available on even a NeXT Motorola 68k computer. Eventually I ported it to C#, provided a WPF Desktop app and eventually a .NET Core CLI tool. However, this limited the platforms I could target - almost explicitly negating any of the older platforms I was more curious about. Those still reading might be asking, why Rust then? It does allow more platforms than C#, while also providing a way to perhaps extend to those older platforms given their list of platforms being fairly <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">large</a>.
